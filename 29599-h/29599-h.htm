<h1><i><big>Homesick</big></i></h1>

<h2>By LYN VENABLE</h2>

<p class="hd1"><big><b>Illustrated by EMSH</b></big></p>

<div class="bk1"><i><big><b>What thrill is there in going out among the
stars if coming back means bitter loneliness?</b></big></i></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Frankston</span> pushed listlessly
at a red checker with
his right forefinger. He
knew the move would cost him
a man, but he lacked enough interest
in the game to plot out a
safe move. His opponent, James,
jumped the red disk with a black
king and removed it from the
board. Gregory, across the room,
flicked rapidly through the pages
of a magazine, too rapidly to be
reading anything, or even looking
at the pictures. Ross lay
quietly on his bunk, staring out
of the viewport.</p>

<p>The four were strangely alike
in appearance, nearly the same
age, the age where gray hairs
finally outnumber black, or baldness
takes over. The age when the
expanding waistline has begun to
sag tiredly, when robust middle
age begins the slow accelerating
decline toward senility.</p>

<p>A strange group to find aboard
a spaceship, but then <i>The Columbus</i>
was a very strange ship.
Bolted to its outer hull, just under
the viewports, were wooden
boxes full of red geraniums, and
ivy wound tenuous green fronds
over the gleaming hull that had
withstood the bombardment of
pinpoint meteors and turned
away the deadly power of naked
cosmic rays.</p>

<p>Frankston glanced at his wristchrono.
It was one minute to six.</p>

<p>"In about a minute," he
thought, "Ross will say something
about going out to water
his geraniums." The wristchrono
ticked fifty-nine times.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go out and water
my geraniums," said Ross.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">No one</span> glanced up. Then
Gregory threw his magazine
on the floor. Ross got up and
walked, limping slightly, to a
wall locker. He pulled out the
heavy, ungainly spacesuit and
the big metal bulb of a headpiece.
He carried them to his
bunk and laid them carefully
down.</p>

<p>"Will somebody please help me
on with my suit?" he asked.</p>

<p>For one more long moment, no
one moved. Then James got up
and began to help Ross fit his
legs into the suit. Ross had arthritis,
not badly, but enough so
that he needed a little help climbing
into a spacesuit.</p>

<p>James pulled the heavy folds
of the suit up around Ross's body
and held it while Ross extended
his arms into the sleeve sections.
His hands, in the heavy gauntlets,
were too unwieldy to do the front
fastenings, and he stood silently
while James did it for him.</p>

<p>Ross lifted the helmet, staring
at it as a cripple might regard a
wheelchair which he loathed but
was wholly dependent upon.
Then he fitted the helmet over
his head and James fastened it
down and lifted the oxygen tank
to his back.</p>

<p>"Ready?" asked James.</p>

<p>The bulbous headpiece inclined
in a nod. James walked to a panel
and threw a switch marked <span class="smcapl">INNER
LOCK</span>. A round aperture slid silently
open. Ross stepped through
it and the door shut behind him
as James threw the switch back
to its original position. Opposite
the switch marked <span class="smcapl">OUTER LOCK</span> a
signal glowed redly and James
threw another switch. A moment
later the signal flickered out.</p>

<p>Frankston, with a violent gesture,
swept the checker board
clean. Red and black men clattered
to the floor, rolling and
spinning. Nobody picked them
up.</p>

<p>"What does he do it for?" demanded
Frankston in a tight
voice. "What does he get out of
those stinking geraniums he can't
touch or smell?"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Gregory.</p>

<p>James looked up sharply. Curtness
was unusual for Gregory, a
bad sign. Frankston was the one
he'd been watching, the one
who'd shown signs of cracking,
but after so long, even a psycho-expert's
opinion might be haywire.
Who was a yardstick? Who
was normal?</p>

<p>"Geraniums don't smell much
anyway," added Gregory in a
more conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Frankston, "I'd
forgotten that. But why does he
torture himself like this, and us,
too?"</p>

<p>"Because that's what he wanted
to do," answered James.</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Gregory, "the
whole trip&mdash;the last twenty years
of it, anyhow&mdash;all he could talk
about was how, when he got back
to Earth, he was going to buy a
little place in the country and
raise flowers."</p>

<p>"Well, we're back," muttered
Frankston, with a terrible bitterness.
"He's raising flowers, but
not in any little place in the
country."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Gregory</span> continued almost
dreamily, "Remember the
last night out? We were all gathered
around the viewscreen. And
there was Earth, getting bigger
and greener and closer all the
time. Remember what it felt like
to be going back, after thirty
years?"</p>

<p>"Thirty years cooped up in this
ship," grumbled Frankston. "All
our twenties and thirties and forties ..."</p>

<p>"But we were coming home."
There was a rapt expression on
Gregory's lined and weathered
face. "We were looking forward
to the twenty or maybe thirty
good years we had left, talking
about what we'd do, where we'd
live, wondering what had
changed on Earth. At least we
had that last night out. All the
data was stashed away in the microfiles,
all the data about planets
with air we couldn't breathe and
food we couldn't eat. We were
going home, home to big, friendly,
green Earth."</p>

<p>Frankston's face suddenly
crumpled as though he were
about to weep and he cradled his
head against his arms. "God, do
we have to go over it all again?
Not again tonight!"</p>

<p>"Leave him alone," ordered
James with an inflection of command
in his voice. "Go to the
other section of the ship if you
don't want to listen. He has to
keep going over it, just like Ross
has to keep watering his geraniums."</p>

<p>Frankston remained motionless
and Gregory looked gratefully
at James. James was the
steady one. It was easier for him
because he understood.</p>

<p>Gregory's face became more
and more animated as he lost
himself, living again his recollections:
"The day we blasted in.
The crowds. Thousands of people,
all there to see us come in. We
were proud. Of course, we
thought we were the first to land,
just like we'd been the first to
go out. Those cheers, coming
from thousands of people at once.
For us. Ross&mdash; Lt. Ross&mdash;was the
first one out of the lock. We'd decided
on that; he'd been in command
for almost ten years, ever
since Commander Stevens died.
You remember Stevens, don't
you? He took over when we lost
Captain Willers. Well, anyway,
Ross out first, and then you,
James, and you, Frankston, and
then Trippitt, and me last, because
you were all specialists and
I was just a crewman. <i>The</i> crewman,
I should say, the only one
left.</p>

<p>"Ross hesitated and almost
stumbled when he stepped out,
and tears began pouring from his
eyes, but I thought&mdash;well, you
know, coming home after thirty
years and all that. But when I
stepped out of the lock, my eyes
stung like fire and a thousand
needles seemed to jab at my skin.</p>

<p>"And then the President himself
stepped forward with the
flowers. That's where the real
trouble began, with the flowers.
I remember Ross stretching out
his arms to take the bouquet, like
a mother reaching for a baby.
Then suddenly he dropped them,
sneezing and coughing and sobbing
for breath, and the President
reached out to help him, asking
him over and over what was
wrong.</p>

<p>"It was the same with all of
us, and we turned and staggered
back to the ship, closing the lock
behind us. It was bad then. God,
I'll never forget it! The five of
us, moaning in agony, gasping for
breath, our eyes all swollen shut,
and the itching ... that itching."
Gregory shuddered.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Even</span> the emotionally disciplined
James set his teeth
and felt his scalp crawl at the
memory of that horror. He
glanced toward the viewport, as
though to cleanse his mind of the
memory. He could see Ross out
there, among the geraniums,
moving slowly and painfully in
his heavy spacesuit. Occupational
therapy. Ross watered flowers
and Gregory talked and Frankston
was bitter and ... himself?
Observation, maybe.</p>

<p>Gregory's voice began again,
"And then they were pounding on
the lock, begging us to let the
doctor in, but we were all rolling
and thrashing with the itching,
burning, sneezing, and finally
James got himself under control
enough to open the locks and let
them in.</p>

<p>"Then came the tests, allergy
tests. Remember those? They'd
cut a little row of scratches in
your arm ..." Each man instinctively
glanced at his forearm,
saw neat rows of tiny pink scars,
row on row. "Then they'd put a
little powder in each cut and each
kind of powder was an extract
of some common substance we
might be allergic to. The charts
they made were full of 'P's, P
for positive, long columns of big,
red 'P's. All pollen, dust, wool,
nylon, cotton, fish, meat, fruit,
vegetables, grain, milk, whisky,
cigarettes, dogs, cats&mdash;everything!
And wasn't it funny about
us being allergic to women's face
powder? Ha! We were allergic
to women from their nylon hose
to their face powder.</p>

<p>"Thirty years of breathing
purified, sterilized, filtered air,
thirty years of drinking distilled
water and swallowing synthetic
food tablets had changed us. The
only things we weren't allergic
to were the metal and plastic and
synthetics of our ship, <i>this</i> ship.
We're allergic to Earth. That's
funny, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Gregory began to rock back
and forth, laughing the thin high
laugh of hysteria. James silently
walked to a water hydrant and
filled a plastic cup. He brought
Gregory a small white pill.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't take this with
the rest of us at supper. You'd
better take it now. You need it."</p>

<p>Gregory nodded bleakly, sobering
at once, and swallowed the
pellet. He made a face after the
water.</p>

<p>"Distilled," he spat. "Distilled
... no flavor ... no life ...
like us ... distilled."</p>

<p>"If only we could have blasted
off again." Frankston's voice
came muffled through his hands.
"It wouldn't have made any difference
where. Anywhere or nowhere.
No, our fine ship is obsolete
and we're old, much too old.
They have the spacedrive now.
Men don't make thirty-year junkets
into space and come back
allergic to Earth. They go out,
and in a month or two they're
back, with their hair still black
and their eyes still bright and
their uniforms still fit. A month
or two is all. Those crowds that
cheered us, they were proud of us
and sorry for us, because we'd
been out thirty years and they
never expected us back at all.
But it was inconvenient for
Spaceport." Bitter sarcasm tinged
his voice. "They actually had to
postpone the regular monthly
Trans-Galactic run to let us in
with this big, clumsy hulk."</p>

<p>"Why didn't we ever see any
of the new ships either going out
or coming back?" asked Gregory.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Frankston</span> shook his head.
"You don't see a ship when it's
in spacedrive. It's out of normal
space-time dimensions. We had a
smattering of the theory at cadet
school ... anyway, if one did
flash into normal space-time&mdash;say,
for instance, coming in for
a landing&mdash;the probability of us
being at the same place at the
same time was almost nil. 'Two
ships passing in the night' as the
old saying goes."</p>

<p>Gregory nodded, "I guess Trippitt
was the lucky one."</p>

<p>"You didn't see Trippitt die,"
replied James.</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Frankston.
"What killed Trippitt? So
quickly, too. He was only outside
a few minutes like the rest of us,
and eight hours later he was
dead."</p>

<p>"We couldn't be sure," answered
James. "Some virus.
There are countless varieties.
People live in a contaminated atmosphere
all their lives, build up
a resistance to them. Sometimes
a particularly virulent strain will
produce an epidemic, but most
people, if they're affected, will
have a mild case of whatever it
is and recover. But after thirty
years in space, thirty years of
breathing perfectly pure, uncontaminated
air, Trippitt had no
antibodies in his bloodstream.
The virus hit and he died."</p>

<p>"But why didn't the rest of us
get it?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"We were lucky. Viruses are
like that."</p>

<p>"Those people talked about
building a home for us," muttered
Frankston. "Why didn't
they?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been any
different," answered James gently.
"It would have been the
same, almost an exact duplicate
of the ship, everything but the
rockets. Same metal and plastic
and filtered air and synthetic
food. It couldn't have had wool
rugs or down pillows or smiling
wives or fresh air or eggs for
breakfast. It would have been
just like this. So, since the ship
was obsolete, they gave it to us,
and a plot of ground to anchor
it to, and we're home. They did
the best they could for us, the
very best they could."</p>

<p>"But I feel stifled, shut in!"</p>

<p>"The ship is large, Frankston.
We all crowd into this section because,
without each other, we'd
go mad." James kicked the edge
of the magazine on the floor.
"Thank God we're not allergic
to decontaminated paper. There's
still reading."</p>

<p>"We're getting old," said Gregory.
"Some day one of us will be
here alone."</p>

<p>"God help him then," answered
James, with more emotion than
was usual for him.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">During</span> the latter part of
the conversation, the little
red signal had been flashing persistently.
Finally James saw it.
Ross was in the outer lock. James
threw the decontaminator switch
and the signal winked out. Every
trace of dust and pollen would
have to be removed from Ross's
suit before he could come inside
the ship.</p>

<p>"Just like on an alien planet,"
commented Gregory.</p>

<p>"Isn't that what this is to us&mdash;an
alien planet?" asked Frankston,
and neither of the other men
dared answer his bitter question.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Ross was
back in the cabin, and James
helped him out of his spacesuit.</p>

<p>"How are the geraniums,
Ross?" asked Gregory.</p>

<p>"Fine," said Ross enthusiastically.
"They're doing just fine."</p>

<p>He walked over to his bunk
and lay down on his side so he
could see out of the viewport.
There would be an hour left before
darkness fell, an hour to
watch the geraniums. They were
tall and red, and swayed slightly
in the evening breeze.</p>
